When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working not from home or whet there many people working on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it would be a big mess when Git decide whether to pull repos from github.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are about cloning repos on GitHub. Clones are about cloning repos on local machine or from github on local machine. Branches are about different flows of the commits. 
I would use fork function when I find interest repo on github and wanna make changes and store it on my github account and want to give some recognition to the author.

Reflect: Local copies of remote branches
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can make diff between this two variants of code without pulling of pushing with github.

Reflect: Collaboration using Git and GitHub
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Oh man. It would be sick thing.

Reflect: When to use a separate branch
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I would want to make changes in a separate branch when I'm not sure if this feature will work out
of I would want to continue working on a master branch while working on the new feature.
As Ð¡aroline pointed, these situations depend on the number of collaborators.
