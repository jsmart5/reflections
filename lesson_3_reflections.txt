When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working not from home or whet there many people working on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it would be a big mess when Git decide whether to pull repos from github.
