When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working not from home or whet there many people working on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it would be a big mess when Git decide whether to pull repos from github.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are about cloning repos on GitHub. Clones are about cloning repos on local machine or from github on local machine. Branches are about different flows of the commits. 
I would use fork function when I find interest repo on github and wanna make changes and store it on my github account and want to give some recognition to the author.

Reflect: Local copies of remote branches
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can make diff between this two variants of code without pulling of pushing with github.
