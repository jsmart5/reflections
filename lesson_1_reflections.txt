I am able to see excact lines where changes were happen.
It's vere handy to find the changes.
I could spend less time on searching those mistakes or changes.
Beacuase automatticaly committs won't understand the logical meaning of commits and 
then it'll be harded to understand the commintts tree.
Because coder's problems are solved not with
the power of one file but with using of many.
The first thing I'm gonna do is to see the log of the commits. The i'll find the rigth one commit,
and then i'll compare that one with the previous one.
If I would code without version control I would afraid of big mistakes that could braak 
all my front-end project. And now I am confident in the future because I can fallback to 
previous version of project evere time I need.
I want to try using git for coding my personal website.
