When I initialize the repo Git creates nev dit called .git and stores here
needed data. I need it to do cause for proper work git should use this data.
The staging area is different from the working dir because it's abstract place and staging area
can contait all or several files from the working dit. Staging area is a part of the repository. 
If offers opportunity to choose what files I want to track and those i don't.
I can use staging area to see the differences between files 
in staging area and recent commit.
They would help me if I want to implement different design of new feature 
but I'm not sure if it will be in production. So if I would wanna see on it without 
breaking me previous code I can use branches.
I see parents of the commits. Withouf the diagrams it would be harder to 
understand the "detached head" message.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

When merging 2 branches together I will have one branch with all the 
changes and coding in one place. It helped me to understand the "detached HEAD" message.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Positive part of automatic merging is that you don't have to 
waste your time on smushing files. The positive of manual merging is that
you have to decide hot to treat different changes in the code and disscuss
it with your collaborators.
