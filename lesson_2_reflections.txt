When I initialize the repo Git creates nev dit called .git and stores here
needed data. I need it to do cause for proper work git should use this data.
The staging area is different from the working dir because it's abstract place and staging area
can contait all or several files from the working dit. Staging area is a part of the repository. 
If offers opportunity to choose what files I want to track and those i don't.
